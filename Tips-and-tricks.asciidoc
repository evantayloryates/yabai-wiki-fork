=== Quickly restart the yabai launch agent

When running through `brew services`, restarting yabai using `brew services restart yabai` can take a few seconds. You can achieve (almost) the same effect by running this command instead:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/${UID}/homebrew.mxcl.yabai"

# e.g. bind to key in skhd:
# ctrl + alt + cmd - r : launchctl kickstart -k "gui/${UID}/homebrew.mxcl.yabai"
```

=== Split yabai configuration across multiple files

The below script loads all executable files (`chmod +x`) in `~/.config/yabai/` and executes them. Why? Because then parts of your config can be reloaded individually from signals or external triggers.

```sh
# find all executable files in ~/.config/yabai and execute them
find "${HOME}/.config/yabai" -type f -perm +111 -exec {} \;
```
