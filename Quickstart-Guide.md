## Quickstart guide

*yabai* can be installed via Homebrew from a custom tap. It does, however, require you to disable *System Integrity Protection* ("rootless"), because it controls windows by acting through _Dock.app_â€”which is the sole owner of the main connection to the window server.

- Disable *System Integrity Protection*
- Install _yabai_
- Allow _yabai_ to control your device using accessibility features
- Install the scripting addition
- Run yabai and restart _Dock.app_
