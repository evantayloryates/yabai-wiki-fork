### What is *yabai*?

*yabai* is a tiling window manager for macOS 10.13.6 and 10.14.4/5. It automatically modifies your window layout using a binary space partitioning algorithm to allow you to focus on the content of your windows without having to 

Integration with [*skhd*](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) allows you to become the macOS power user you have always wanted to be. Create custom keybindings to control windows, spaces and displays in practically no time and get your hands off the mouse and trackpad and back onto the keyboard where actual work gets done.

### Quickstart guide

*yabai* can be installed via Homebrew from a custom tap. It does, however, require you to disable *System Integrity Protection* ("rootless"), because it controls windows by acting through _Dock.app_â€”which is the sole owner of the main connection to the window server.

- Disable *System Integrity Protection*
- Install _yabai_
- Allow _yabai_ to control your device using accessibility features
- Install the scripting addition
- Run yabai and restart _Dock.app_
